        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          North Indian in origin, I was very grateful to have found this recipe.
          It is very similar to what was served to us by our Bengali neighbors
          years ago! Serve hot with a side of thickly sliced bread.

          <li>1 large potato - cooked, peeled, and cut into 1-inch cubes</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in onions;
            cook and stir until onion pieces are soft and translucent, about 5
            minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low; continue cooking, stirring
            occasionally, until onions are golden, about 10 minutes more.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove pan from heat and set it aside. Transfer cooked onions to the
            bowl of a food processor; grind onions, tomatoes, and green chiles
            into a smooth paste.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in the same skillet over medium
            heat. Add onion mixture carefully, as it may spatter. Cook and stir
            for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in garlic paste, ginger paste, coriander,
            cumin, garam masala, turmeric, cayenne pepper, and salt. Cook and
            stir until the oil begins to separate from the mixture, about 5
            minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour water into skillet and bring sauce to a boil. Add cubed
            potatoes. Gently stir in the eggs. Reduce heat to low and simmer
            until sauce has thickened slightly, about 10 minutes. Remove from
            heat. Garnish with cilantro before serving.
          </li>

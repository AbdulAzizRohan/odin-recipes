    <h1>Bengali Fish Curry</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A delicate Bengali fish curry. In India, the best parts of a fish are
      often reserved as a fillet and served grilled, broiled, or cooked
      alongside a fish stew or curry containing the less attractive portions of
      fish. The contrasting texture combination is worth trying at your dinner
      table.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 large tomatoes, coarsely chopped</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ground turmeric</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 cups water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 pounds thick whitefish fillets, cut into large chunks</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon mustard seeds</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon black cumin seeds</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon fennel seeds, lightly crushed</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon fenugreek seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring the tomatoes, cumin, turmeric, salt, and water to a boil in a four
        quart saucepan; reduce heat to medium and maintain a simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; cook the fish in the
        oiled skillet until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer the
        fish to the saucepan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a separate skillet over medium heat, and toast the mustard seeds,
        cumin seeds, black cumin seeds, fennel seeds, and fenugreek seeds until
        fragrant, just a few seconds. Stir the spices into the saucepan. Simmer
        until the flavors integrate, about 10 minutes more. Serve hot.
      </li>
    </ol>
